  <h1 class='title_story'>Our Story</h1>
  <p class='story'>Cra-Z-Art, based in Randolph, New Jersey, is a prime manufacturer and global leader in classic toy, arts and crafts kits, puzzles and school supplies. 
    The Cra-Z-Art management team has over 150 years of experience in creating, manufacturing and marketing these quality items.

    After successfully leading the sale of his family’s toy company, RoseArt, Lawrence Rosen found that he couldn’t stay away from the industry he loved, so he started Cra-Z-Art in 2008
    – the family has been in the toy industry for over a 100 years. Cra-Z-Art has grown quickly in sales, becoming a leader in classic toy and school supply products.
     The company produces and globally markets such popular toy items as Arts and Craft kits, Jigsaw Puzzles, Art Supplies, Cra-Z-Loom, Softee Dough, The Real Cotton Candy Maker, 
     Shimmer and Sparkle Girls Activity Kits, Disney arts and crafts, Magna Doodle and Snoopy Sno Cone. The company has also opened an international sales office in England to support i
     ncreased international growth.
    The key reason for the company’s success and longevity is being on the pulse of what kids crave. Cra-Z-Art is known for discovering hot trends and quickly bringing quality products 
    to market for children and adults to enjoy.
    
    Early in 2021, LaRose Industries, LLC, the parent company of Cra-Z-Art, announced it purchased RoseArt back from the Mattel toy company. The purchase was an important and 
    celebratory milestone for LaRose and Lawrence Rosen as it reunited the RoseArt brands with the Rosen family. In 2023, RoseArt proudly celebrated its 100th anniversary. 
    RoseArt brands include popular Scribble Stuff pens, Premium Art Supplies, Kodak jigsaw puzzles and USA Gold Pencils.</p><br>
